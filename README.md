Conceptual Expertise In Sorting Task.
TLDR: This program is used to import required data from a game and export it into a readable Excel table.

In this project, participants are required play a game where they must sort items from multiple chests into different chests. This point of this experiment
is to analyze the behaviour of the volunteers' sorting behaviour. In the game, an advanced command is used to display the items in the multiple chests into the
server chat. The server's logs are then acquired and dissected. This program is used to filter required data from the server logs. This data is then exported into
an Excel sheet called "results.xlsx".

This program will not operate without required dependencies. Please contact andrewvcle@icloud.com to gain access to these dependencies.
